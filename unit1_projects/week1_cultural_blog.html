    <h2>When you think of the times in your life where you have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h2>
    <p>The moments I find most satisfying in life are the ones I share with my family. In my eyes, everything comes and goes, career, material things, romance, friendships... but family remains that one constant. They're my homebase. They are my motivation in life, I want to make them proud, I want to be able to protect and protect for them. At the same time they offer unconditional love and support without asking for anything in return.</p>

When met with the same decision I would've gone all in with what's likely the best hand at the moment and position on my the opponents.
