		<h2>About me</h2>
		</header>
			<p>My name is Kaitlyn Tram La from San Jose, Ca. I have two brothers and five sisters, I'm number five of eight. Prior to DBC, my younger brother and I decided to open <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/song-ngu-restaurant-milpitas-2"> Song Ngu Restaurant</a> together in September of 2010. We were bought out last November which put me in the fortunate situation of being afforded the time and resources to explore my hobbies and interests. Looking for new pursuits to conquer I turned towards technology. Programming is something I've always promised I would teach myself when I had more time. Over the years I've managed to go through a Python and RoR tutorial when I found myself with a free weekend. Aside from that I haven't spent any significant amount of time learning enough to be proficient. Craving knowledge and looking for more guidance I came upon Dev Bootcamp, after researching the program and watching a few Shereef Bishay video's I found myself inspired and ready to drink the Kool-aid. <br>

			**Side note: Right off the bat you'll probably notice I'm rather quiet, that's because I'm an introvert through and through. Fret not, I warm up to most people in little time. Also if you ever find yourself wondering why I look like 'that', this video will explain my affliction... <br>
