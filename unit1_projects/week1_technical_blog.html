    <h2>Website Review</h2>
		<h3><a href="www.google.com">Google</a></h3>
			<p>I first discovered Google in high school and have been a loyal user ever since. The simplicity in it's design makes it's very appealing. Your eyes are met with a superimposed logo displayed over a clean white background. A simple search bar opens a dialogue between you and Google. The site itself is fast and reliable, it offers a very user friendly experience. Navigating through the site is highly intuitive, anyone with basic literacy can use it. As far as content, Google is the gateway to the internet, it's content is all encompassing. They do sell advertisement space but their ads are so subtle I rarely notice them. Usually a downfall for other search engines.</p>

		<h3><a href="www.seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a></h3>
			<p>Serious Eats is a food blog I visit frequently, mostly for their writer Kenji Alt-Lopez, an extremely passionate foodie. He breaks every aspect of cooking down to an exact science. The site offers plenty of visual stimulants in form of food photography, your senses are captivated by the vivid photo's and your brain is stimulated by endless well written articles. Their logo also features my favorite color orange which gives the site a bright and happy appearance. Every link is paired with a prominent photo so what you see is what you get as far as navigating goes. I think they've struck the right balance between the photo and text content. </p>

		<h3><a href="www.deadspin.com">Deadspin</a></h3>
			<p>Deadspin is where I go to get my sports fix; I appreciate their brand of humor above all else. Visually they won't win any design awards. A small logo heads it's front page, you scroll up and down for content. They offer links to related blogs in the side bar. A slightly enlarged and bold font makes up each articles header followed by a small photograph. I've noticed they're slowing moving away from using large photo's to accompany their articles. Which seem counter-intuitive to me because a photo commands more attention than big black text. The photo to text ratio is off, which creates a very boring page..</p>
