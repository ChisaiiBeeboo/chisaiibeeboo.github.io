      <p>In my past life as a female professional poker player I would often, well always, be surrounded by men. When it came to stereotype threats there was good and bad. Some men assumed I didn't know how to play which made the games extremely lucrative. Then there are those who do realize I understand the game and avoid playing hands with me, essentially killing my action. That definitely hurt my bottom line.</p>
