      <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>
      <h3>What are they? </h3>
        <p>
          <b>our_array = [ 3, "cat", true, [], {} ]</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          An array is a list(or collection) of objects/data that is ordered by indexed-position. Because computers always start count from zero indexing begins at 0 for the first position, 1 for the second position, 2 for the third position and well you get the idea... Indexing makes it simple to access the objects of an array through it's position, for example our_array[1] would return "cat". Arrays can hold just about anything you throw at it integers, booleans, strings, hashes even other arrays. 
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>our_hash = { "Phone Number:" => '555-555-5555', "Address:" => '1 Elm St, San Jose, CA 95123' }</b>
        <br>
        <br>
          Hashes store data in the form of an unordered list made of key-value pairs, unlike arrays' indexed-positioning, hashes are accessed through their unique keys. You're free to assign the uniques key and values to anything you like, for example: <p>{'color' => 'orange'} or '{food' => 'chicken wings'}<p>
        }
        </p>
        <h3>What are they good for?</h3>
        <p>
          Hashes and Arrays are data containers you can use as a reference, for example: when you need to decipher a certain North Korean message.
        </p>

      <h3>How do you know which one to use?</h3>
        <p>
          If you need to store data in a particular order you should use arrays. Like the alphabet:

          <p>["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]</p>

           If you're storing data with unique keys, and varying values like a contact list for example you should use a hash.
           <p> contacts = { 'moms' => 666-666-6666, 'dad' => 555-555-5555, 'pizza' => speed dial #1 } </p>
        </p>
