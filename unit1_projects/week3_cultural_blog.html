    <h2>Fireside Chat w/ Shereef Bishay</h2>
      <p>Coming from owning a restaurant, this talk really hit home for me. In building up my restaurant I invested 3 years of my life, maxed out all my resources, physically pushed myself to the limit, and alienated my loved ones. It's an experience that demands everything of you, you're foregoing any semblance of balance in life. On a typical day it was complete chaos, there are challenges and obstacles every single step of the way. You're exhausted, you're uncomfortable, you're learning, you're doing damage control all at once. That feeling of being overwhelmed and lost is ever-present. These are feelings I've grown very comfortable with which makes me feel more confident going into DBC. I had so much more at stake with the restaurant that DBC feels like pizza party compared to the last 3 years.</p>

      <p>As with anything in life, I understand you get what you put in and nothing is guaranteed. That is why the only expectations I have for DBC is this very "magical experience" and the opportunity to connect with other awesome human beings. It's that special comradery that forms when you go on a journey like this together, an endeavor so few people experience in life. It's that pressure cooker enviroment I crave. It's the passion I seek in life. This talk only reaffirmed my decision to apply to DBC. </p>
