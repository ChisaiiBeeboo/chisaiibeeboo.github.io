      <h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h2>
        <p>The last emotional conflict I had was with a nephew of mine, 'T', who is 11 y/o. I had taken 'T' and his siblings to Chuck E. Cheese for
           some fun and pizza because my sister needed them out of the house for a few hours. He used inappropriate language around his younger siblings, as well as the younger children around us. 'T' pretty much spent the entire time complaining about everything and being extremely obnoxious. I was embarassed by the way the other parents looked at us, more importantly I was disappointed in his behavior. 
        </p>
      <h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>
        <p>'T''s inability to be considerate of those around him and his general demeanor toward authority. </p>
      <h2>How did you handle that conflict?</h2>
        <p>I advised that "if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all", advice he chose to ignore. After reaching my tipping point, I simply took away his tokens and told him he lost his fun privelages due to his poor behavior.
        </p>
      <h2>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>
        <p>Well I successful in getting him to stop being loud and obnoxious. 'T' generally avoided contact with me for the duration of the outing, save for a few attempts at an insincere apology. He started tearing up when he realized I meant business and definitely showed a lot of anger and resentment towards me. I'd like to think he got a good lesson about the consequences of his actions out of the whole ordeal. 
        </p>
      <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty happy with the way I handled the situation, my initial instinct told me to berate him in public. But I know all too well shame is a terrible motivator. 
        </p>
      <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2>
        <p>Never have kids. I'm kidding. Children need discipline, early and consistently. Even if 'T' doesn't change his ways, he'll atleast know he won't get away with this type of behavior around me.</p>
